        <div class="about-cont">I'm a first year student of BCA at Invertis University learning coding and technology eager to learn several other new things to attain expertise in this feild.I want to become a Software developer currently i am focusing on some Frontend Developmet skills starting from learning Html to CSS , Javascript and many more things.Apart from this i am also good at communication as i was a literary secretary at my school and also i was given the title of the Oratory icon of the batch 2024-25. I beleive that one should never give up on their dreams and goals because if you would show some energy and enthusiasm then only the target and goals could be achieved try your best and still things don't work out take it as a lesson for future.my only Mantra to success which i believe should be everyone's is Discipline and Punctuality.</div>
